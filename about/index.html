<p>I started writing code in 2008 and working professionally as a developer in 2012. I build web applications with Ruby on Rails and web sites with Middleman and have a solid grasp of JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS. I actively <a href="https://cooperpress.com/">follow news</a> to stay up to date in each of the respective technologies I regularly use. I am a curious introvert and prefer to work with distributed teams but also willing to work on site for the right situation.</p>

<h2 id="team-player">Team Player</h2>

<p>As a former Art Director, I still enjoy UI/Design tasks like wire framing, UX diagrams, and mentoring graphic designers who want to learn to code. I voluntarily manage LivingSocial's Boulder office and have initiated culture improvements like forming book and code clubs.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://dribbble.com/wwwoodall">dribbble</a> for fun.</p>

<h2 id="bc-before-coding">B.C. <em>(before coding)</em></h2>

<p>During college I started a t-shirt business. The year was 2000 and the <em>dot com</em> bubble had just burst so I deduced the web was a fad and should focus on the apparel industry. It only took eight years to realize I was wrong.</p>

<p>I began to view code as a new form of literacy. Like many people, I had lots of Internet business ideas. But after several unsuccessful attempts with 3rd party sites, consultants, and other hacks I realized that I needed to learn to code for myself. So, I moved my family from Denver to Florida for three months so that I could attend <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">starter league</a> in Chicago. That was the catalyst I needed to make the switch.</p>

<p>In total, I spent 17 years in the apparel and music industries including - three turnarounds, founding two companies, and selling one. I have experience with acquiring profitable customers and I'm formally trained with a Masters in Finance.</p>

<p>Coding is my fifth career and by far my favorite of them all. My longest active commit streak is <a href="https://github.com/woodall">193 days</a>.</p>
