## My path to programming

I started a business in college designing and printing t-shirts for bands, camps, churches, summer camps, and anyone else who would buy from me. The year was 2000 and the dot com bubble had just burst so I deduced the web was just a fad. Fast forward 8 years when I started to realize that the web didn't die. 

I confess that I did not start writing code for technical reasons like build an assembler, study machine code, or write my own language. I just wanted to create transactions in ways that were unique and original so that meant learning to build web apps by myself rather than rely on someone else. 

I started to see code as a new literacy. The fact that I couldn't read or write felt claustrophobic. I started dabbling with Rails and it took me four years before I knew enough to code full time. Coding is my fifth career and by far my favorite of them all.
